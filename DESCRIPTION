Description: Nonparametric smoothing techniques for
    data on a lattice and functional time series. Smoothing is done via
    kernel regression or local polynomial regression, a bandwidth selection
    procedure based on an iterative plug-in algorithm is implemented. This
    package allows for modeling a dependency structure of the error terms
    of the nonparametric regression model.
